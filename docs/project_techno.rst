Project Used Technologies
==========================

The project utilizes a variety of technologies and programming languages.

Programming Languages
----------------------

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the development of the project's backend. Python is utilized in creating Django views, models, and other core functionalities.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language used for creating the structure of web pages. HTML provides the skeleton of the web pages, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web pages and enhancing the user interface of the project.
- **SQL**: The language used for managing and querying the SQLite database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

Technologies and Tools
----------------------

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django is used to handle the backend logic, routing, and database interactions.
- **Docker**: A tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Docker ensures that the application runs smoothly in different environments by packaging it with all its dependencies.
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used to track changes in the project's source code. It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool that automates the process of testing and deploying the application. It helps ensure that the codebase remains stable and that new changes do not introduce bugs.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, disk-based database used for development and testing. It requires minimal setup and configuration, making it ideal for smaller projects and quick iterations.

Deployment
----------

- **Render**: A cloud platform used for deploying the web application. Render provides a seamless deployment experience, managing the infrastructure and scaling the application as needed.
